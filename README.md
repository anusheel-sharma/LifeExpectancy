# LifeExpectancy
Analysis of life expectancy data from WHO and UN

This data was downloaded from Kaggle. 

Using this data, I built a Random Forest Regressor that could predict the average life expectancy for a country, given particular socio-economic factors.

I have provided the dataset hosted on Kaggle in the form of a csv file. 

I have also provided my analysis in the form of a Jupyter Notebook which sets out various visualisations and the results of my model.
